### README

This is a Github repository for the workshops given as part of the University of Waterloo's Statistical Workshops and Applications Group (SWAG) club.

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.*


### Some instructios on uploading your RMarkdown files to this bookdown repo

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. Do `git clone https://github.com/UWSWAGCLUB/workshop-bookdown.git` in your terminal.

2. Write your own RMarkdown file, say, `my_chapter.rmd`. 

3. When you have finished your Rmd file, knit the Rmd file to html to check for the ouput.

4. If your file takes over 30 secs to knit, or if your file requires packages that are not commonly used by most people (e.g. packages that are not `ggplot2`, 
`dplyr`, `MASS`), go to step 5, otherwise, go to step 8.

5. Rename your Rmd file from `my_chapter.rmd` to `my_chapter.rmd.orig` by `git mv my_chapter.rmd my_chapter.rmd.orig`. **A very important point** is to add this at the beginning of 
your `.rmd.orig` file: `opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "figure/chapter_name/")`. This saves all the generated figures in one folder for your chapter. If you don't do this, the figures
will be given random names and they might overwrite other existing figures from other chapters.

6. Run `knitr::knit("my_chapter.Rmd.orig", output = "my_chapter.Rmd")`. This generates an Rmd file with figures and coded embedded but the code chunks are are not run.
The generated plots are all saved in the figure folder. The resulted Rmd file takes zero time to knit now.

7. One issue with this trick is that all plots generated by R code chunks will be automatically given captions such as "plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3". E.g., you will see
a lot of `![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](some_figure.png)`. Since we don't want these random captions, it is better to go to the newly generated Rmd file and manually delete 
all these captions.

8. If satisfied with the output html, go ahead and recompile the whole book by `bookdown::render_book()` with the R working directory set to the repo directory. Now the bookdown
has been updated. Check index.html in the doc folder to see if everything turns out okay.

9. Make a pull request to have your file merged with the main branch.
